# colour-magic
**“Color Magic”** is an artistic oil paint blending tool created by and for artists. It is available for **free** use under an MIT license. The tool aims to bridge the gap between physical painting and digital painting. **While it is based on physics and research, it doesn’t precisely mimic real-life paint behaviour.** Creative adjustments have been made to the algorithm to enhance the gradient and achieve a more realistic appearance.

I began this project while reflecting on my oil painting and wondering why I couldn’t recreate it digitally. I soon realized the challenges involved. **The Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory is commonly used for colour blending in industry, but it has its limitations.** This linear formula may not fully capture the intricate behaviour of pigments in reality. Additionally, the KM theory has been proven to be flawed in certain situations, such as when one pigment concentration overwhelms another. **I am by no means a physicist/material scientist, so I had to find a creative (artistic) workaround here.**
