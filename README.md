# colour-magic
**“Color Magic”** is an artistic oil paint blending tool created by and for artists. It is available for **free** use under an MIT license. The tool aims to bridge the gap between physical painting and digital painting. **While it is based on physics and research, it doesn’t precisely mimic real-life paint behaviour.** Creative adjustments have been made to the algorithm to enhance the gradient and achieve a more realistic appearance.
